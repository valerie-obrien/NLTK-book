# Define a function called vocab_size(text) that has a single parameter for the text, 
# and which returns the vocabulary size of the text.

# I think vocabulary size means number of unique words.

def vocab_size(text):
	return len(set(text))

# Check it.
vocab_size(text1)
len(set(text1))

# They are the same.
