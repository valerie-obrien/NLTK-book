# We have been using sets to store vocabularies. Try the following Python expression: 
# set(sent3) < set(text1).

# Experiment with this using different arguments to set().
# What does it do? Can you think of a practical application for this?
# This returns an answer: True or False
# It tells you whether the words in the text from the left side are contained 
# within the text on the right. Specifically, that expression tells us that Moby Dick
# contains all the words in the first sentence of Genesis.
# This can tell us a great deal about the relationship between two texts.
# We can see if a subset of words is contained within another text.
