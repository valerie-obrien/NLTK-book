# What is the difference between the following two lines? 
# Which one will give a larger value? 
# Will this be the case for other texts?

# sorted(set(w.lower() for w in text1))
# sorted(w.lower() for w in set(text1))

# The first takes all the words in the text, makes them lowercase, and then returns 
# the unique words, sorted.
# The second takes all unique words (distinguishing between upper and lower case), 
# makes them lowercase, and then sorts them.
# There will be duplicates in the second, but not the first.
# The second one will return a larger number in this case and in most cases.
# If the text was already uniform in its case (e.g. all words lowercase), 
# the two expressions would have the same output.

# Note: when trying to interpret an expression, start with the innermost parentheses
# and work your way outwards, figuring out what each piece means.
