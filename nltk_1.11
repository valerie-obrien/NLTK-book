# Define several variables containing lists of words, e.g., phrase1, phrase2, and so on. 
phrase1 = ["My", "name", "is", "Valerie", ","]
phrase2 = ["and", "I", "love", "linguistics"]

# Join them together in various combinations (using the plus operator) to form whole 
# sentences.
phrase1 + phrase2
phrase2 + phrase1

# What is the relationship between len(phrase1 + phrase2) and len(phrase1) + len(phrase2)?
# They return the same output.
