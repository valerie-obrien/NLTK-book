# Define a variable my_sent to be a list of words, using the syntax 
# my_sent = ["My", "sent"] (but with your own words, or a favorite saying).
my_sent = ["I", "love", "linguistics"]

# Use ' '.join(my_sent) to convert this into a string.
' '.join(my_sent)

# Use split() to split the string back into the list form you had to start with.
# Python gives me an error saying split is not defined.
