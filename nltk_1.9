# Define a string and assign it to a variable, e.g., my_string = 'My String' 
#(but put something more interesting in the string). 
my_string = 'My name is Valerie'

# Print the contents of this variable in two ways, first by simply typing the 
# variable name and pressing enter, then by using the print statement.
my_string
print(my_string)

# Try adding the string to itself using my_string + my_string, or multiplying 
# it by a number, e.g., my_string * 
my_string + my_string
my_string * 4

# Notice that the strings are joined together without any spaces. 
# How could you fix this?
print((my_string + ' ') * 4)
